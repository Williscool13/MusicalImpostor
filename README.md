# MusicalImpostor
All the code for my game "Musical Impostor" submitted to the 20 Second Jam 2023

It's a 3D game where you are given 20 seconds to locate an impostor musician in a crowd of 20 orchestra members. The impostor is a criminal and doesn't know how to play his instrument, so keep an ear out for the fruit making the wrong noise for the instrument they're holding.

Personal Learning Points: 
 - Working in 3d Space (all other past games were in 2d space)
 - Fullscreen shaders (circle wipe and some experimentation on toon shading)
 - Lighting (Baked, Environment)
 - Cinemachine
 - Timeline
 - Scriptable Object Dependency Injection
 - Unity's New Input System
